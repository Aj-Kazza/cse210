## Introduction
---
Introducing that one game that you've always played as a kid, and that other game you also played as a kid: RPSLS The One Dimentional Version!

You may ask yourself, "where external play games window?", well, we also ask ourself that question! Due to time constraints and other problems, our problems are now your problems! Fun ain't it!?

### Features
---
+ take on 7, yes, <b>SEVEN</b>, different enemies! Each with different and unique attack patterns and illustrations
+ yes, you heard us right the first time, <b>ILLUSTRATIONS!!</b> "how?" you might ask. MAGIC
+ one of the few games ever where you have to type in your attack name! yes, no more clicking, tapping or hovering! you get to type out your attack from a series of 5 different powerful attacks!
+ an unbelievably made rpg type of game accessible through python terminal! <b>NO NEED OF 3RD PARTY PLUGINS TO PLAY!!</b>
+ why would you need audio for this when you can just make them yourself? you get hit? let out a grunt. your opponent gets hit? let out a hoorah. you get a draw? let out a gasp of surprise! the world is yours to imagine!

## How to play
---
Basically what is mentioned above, so... yeah, I reccomend spamming rocks as most oponents are weak to rocks in this game, but that's just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.

All you have to do to run the game... is open it!!??

### System Requirement
+ python v3
+ a working computer
+ a basic rock paper scissors knowledge
+ do not be fooled by the slime's cute appearance
+ a working keyboard
+ a willingness to play a game that doesn't even have an external window

---

+ better graphics (on the standards of a GameBoyColor)
+ music!
+ new and innova- not really inovative, it's basically been done to death at this point, but it's still cool, <i><b>DECK BUILDING MECHANICS!!!</b></i>
+ SUPPORT US ON BYU-I, yes, your scoring would help us a lot to develop a better version of this game (but mostly for our grades)
